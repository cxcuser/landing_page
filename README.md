# landing_page
Main/Final html/css project from T.O.P. foundations

This project is the 'Landing Page' project, which completes
the html/css part of the Foundations component of the T.O.P.
Web Development course. The remainder of the Foundations 
component, I believe, is an introduction to Javascript.
